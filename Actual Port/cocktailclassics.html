                <p class="text-cell">This was a group project for an interface design class where we had to design a
                    fully interactive
                    mobile app from scratch. Our goal was to create an intuitive app where everyone could easily
                    replicate and shake up the famous cocktail classics at their home. <br>
                    This project was undertaken to in order to understand the principles of user interface design. The goal was to understand the necessary steps from start to finish to create an interface. Defining our goals and objective. Then doing our market research to making mock-ups and prototypes.</p>

                <span class="dash"> </span>
                <p>Our project timeline was 3 weeks. My role for this project was mainly the developer interface
                    designer. My partners Zax Chen and Liv Bennet were the main graphic and interface designers. As the
                    developer, my responsibility for my team was to let my team know which interface was feasible and
                    what’s not since I had little experience in mobile development.</p>

                <h2> The Problem</h2>
                <span class="dash"> </span>
                <p>The course doesn’t teach how to make mobile app only how to design it and I was the only developer
                    and I wasn’t very good at it. With the scarce timeline given I had to figure out everything from the
                    layout to implementing a sensor to the app as a mandatory requirement for the project. I could not
                    use any mobile prototyping tool since a sensor was involved. However, In my attempt of desperately
                    searching I had come across a tool called ProtoPie that allowed mobile sensor implementation in the
                    prototype. This discovery freed up a lot of time resource that allowed me focus more on the
                    interface design and time to conduct a heuristic evaluation to gain feedback on our product.</p>
