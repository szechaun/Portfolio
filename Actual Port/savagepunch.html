            <div>
                <p class="text-cell">This is a machine equipped with sensors which are monitored by Arduino a
                    programable logic controller. It is a stress-release model designed for all frustrated students who
                    are overwhelmed with school work. To release stress student can shout and beat at the machine
                    racking up points and measuring their galvanic skin response
                    This was a school project that was undertaken in order to understand how program microcontrollers
                    and how to use the sensor readings to create an interactive machine. </p>

                <p>The development tie for this project was 2 weeks. My role for this project was the developer. My
                    partner Jamie Zhang and David Lee would do the schematics and physical model. Because we were all on
                    point with our task assigned, we were able to meet the deadline comfortably. </p>

                <span class="dash"> </span>
                <p>The issue I face with my task was finding a way to get retrieve the sensor input I wanted. Because we used 3 sensors in our machine there would always be moments where we would get multiple sensor reading at the same time from different sensors. To get around this, I looked up online and figured out that I just need to make each sensor values unique. If I add a different character in front and at the end of each reading from the different sensors I could then parse it later since the reading are now unique to each sensors. Allowing me to get the specific readings I want to add certain interactions to the machine</p>

                <div>
                    <p class="text-cell">In the first iteration, the challenge was to combine the feedback of the initial
                        research we had done based on user interview. Our team had gone out to ask potential users their
                        interest in the app and what features they would expect. After that we made sketches of possible
                        interface designs and begin making the mock-up implementing features the users expected and ones our
                        team thought necessary. We then had a feedback session with our professor and his complaint was that
                        there was not consistency between pages. The slides animation that does the same function needed to
                        be the same across all pages. Also we needed better visual indication of features like selecting a
                        drink to the favorite menu. For our final iteration, everything went very well. I was really proud
                        of our teams work. We did not have too much to fix based on our professorâ€™s previous comment since
                        he liked the overall interface. We did do an user experience testing where we had volunteers preform
                        some assigned tasks in our app and those went fine as the user had an easy time figuring out our
                        interface. </p>
