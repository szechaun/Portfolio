                <p>The development tie for this project was 2 weeks. My role for this project was the developer. My partner Jamie Zhang and David Lee would do the schematics and physical model. Because we were all on point with our task assigned, we were able to meet the deadline comfortably. </p>

                <span class="dash"> </span>
                <p>The issue I face with my task was finding a way to get retrieve the sensor input I wanted. Because we used 3 sensors in our machine there would always be moments where we would get multiple sensor reading at the same time from different sensors. To get around this, I looked up online and figured out that I just need to make each sensor values unique. If I add a different character in front and at the end of each reading from the different sensors I could then parse it later since the reading are now unique to each sensors. Allowing me to get the specific readings I want to add certain interacstions to the machine </p>
