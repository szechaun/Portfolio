                <p class="text-cell">Machine equipped with sensors which are monitored by Arduino, a
                    programable logic controller. It is a stress-release model designed for all frustrated students who
                    are overwhelmed with school work. To release stress, students can shout and beat at the machine, racking up points by measuring their galvanic skin responses.<br><br>
                    I created this for a school project that was taken in order to understand how programmable microcontrollers work
                    and how to use their sensor readings to create an interactive machine. </p>

                <span class="dash"> </span>
                <p>The development time for this project was 2 weeks and my role for this project was the developer. My
                    partner Jamie and David roles were to design schematics and physical model. Because we were all on
                    point with our task assigned, we were able to meet the deadline comfortably. </p>

                <h2> The Problem</h2>
                <span class="dash"> </span>
                <p>The issue I face with my task was finding a way to get the sensor input I wanted. Because we used 3 sensors, the would always be moments where we get multiple sensor reading at the same time from different sensors. This created a problem for our visualization because it is only supposed to get the readings from a specific sensor. To get around this, I researched online and figured out that I could to make each sensor values output from Arduino unique. If I add a different character in front and at the end of each reading from the different sensors I could then parse it later since the reading are now unique to each sensor. Allowing me to get the specific readings I want to specify certain interactions to the machine.</p>
