        <h3>Hi, I'm Tim</h3>
        <p>I am currently a student at Simon Fraser University studying Interactive Art. I am hoping to become a web
            developer and so I am building up my development skills to a professional level through studying and
            personal projects. </p>
        <!-- 
        <h3>Ethos</h3>
        <p>I definitely envision the people who would use our service to be someone who is hosting a event like a
            wedding or party where they need to buy alcohol in bulk.
            <figure>
                <img id="brad" src="https://cdn.weddingbells.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-ten-wedding-reception-songs-01.jpg"
                    alt="wedding">
                <figcaption>fig.1 Persona</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>


                A quick persona would be someone like Brad who is 25 and is having a wedding. Brad doesn't want to
                spend a
                fortune hiring a catering service in which he knows the alcohol selection would be subpar so he orders
                bottles he knows that his guest would like. I also expect people to use our service for convenience
                sake,
                so for someone who doesn't feel like heading outside to buy it themselves.
            </p>

            <h3>Why might this company entice someone to purchase a product or service.</h3>
            <p>Pro:Convenience<br>
                People can continue their activity while delivery would be on its way. It will definitely attract
                people
                with limited time</p>
            <p>Pro:Discover New Bottles<br>
                While customers could definitely discover new bottles pacing around a physical store, our site offers
                an
                convenient and intuitive way for them to browse and explore new experiences. </p> -->
        <h3 id="link-palettes">Color Palettes</h3>
        <figure>
            <img id="palette" src="img/newpalette.png" alt="palette">

        </figure>
        <p>I have chosen a extremely colorful palette. I wanted the site to be very upbeat and to reflect upon myself
            as a person. I want people to think that I am curious and that I am willing to try new things. </p>
        <h3 id="link-fonts">Fonts</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Element</th>
                <th>Font</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Title</td>
                <td id="Gloria">Gloria Hallelujah</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Body</td>
                <td id="OpenSans">Open Sans</td>
            </tr>

        </table>

        <h3>Potentail imagery, and , or , art direction</h3>
        <p>I want the direction of the company to go towards green and sustainability since the product we will be
            promoting is mainly local craft brewery. However, I also want the site to be extremely intuative for
            new
            users so I want clear consistency between pages and easily readable fonts.</p>

                Sufficient malt is there to provide support. At 7% alc/vol and 80+ IBUs this beer delivers on the

                This was a projet from a class called Interactive Art and Technology: Internet Computing Technology in
                which we learned how to build web application using PHP. In this project I integrated a database with
                PHP which could prefrom queries to your specific selection. The tools used here was PHP, SQl, and a web
                server using XAMPP. Since this was my first time working with SQL, I had trouble all over using SQL
                from doing input error check to concentinating SQl strings, and to even setting up a DB using root
                login. However, I was able to break apart each problem with splitting them into smaller chunks going
                over each one by one. I solved each problem going over the documentation and teh textbook we were
                given. In the end, I was able to complete the project with all funtionalities included. Users were able
                to query parameters using order number and order date. They were able to select on the control which
                information to be displayed when the query is successful.

                    This was a final project for the course Interactive Arts and Technology: Interface Design. For this project my group Liv, Zack, and me had to create and design a mobile app from scratch. We began by going to the drawing board brainstorming ideas of what we would like to make, and we decided on a app to teach people how to mix drinks. We then went through an interactive design process first by determining our design domain our target group and began creating personas for people who would use our app then we started to sketch our mock up interfaces. As we had decided on what we wanted we began to make prototypes using tools like Sketch and Photoshop. When everything was to our expectation we created an interactive prototype using Protopie.
